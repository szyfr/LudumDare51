THEME: Every 10 seconds



Ideas:
 - Endless runner
 - running around on falling blocks
   - 3D? / 2D? / *Isometric 2.5D*?
   - *Survival*? / competetive?
   - Run around and use powers to survive while blocks fall every 10 seconds.
   - If you reach the last block the map resets but you keep your time.
   - Maybe map gets bigger? 


Work:
 - Player controler		-Done
   | Jumping is acting weird
   | Instead of stamina bar, jumping removes even more health
 - World generation		-Good enough
   | Regenerate world when map over
 - Tile dissapearance	-Done
   | Tiles dissapear after standing on them for too long
   | The tiles that will be destroyed show in red
   | Figure out how to make it transition from gray to red, not black to red
   | Leave one tile
 - Score keeper + UI	-Done
 - Power ups			-As done as i can
   - Dash
   | Extra-life
   - Teleport up
   - Force tile to stay
   - Create tile
 - Map hazards			-Maybe not. It's already going to be hard enough.
   - Strong wind
